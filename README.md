The provided code for Sign Restricted VAR in Eviews offers a comprehensive solution for estimating VAR models with sign restrictions. By unzipping the file, you gain access to a collection of Eviews programs and subroutines that can be executed directly from the designated folder. The "run_sr.prg" serves as a versatile template allowing customization of various settings to explore the intricacies of sign restrictions.

The code's main objective is to provide a hands-on experience in understanding sign restrictions through direct implementation. It encompasses two exemplary implementations: Uhlig's Results, derived from an agnostic identification procedure ("run_uhlig"), and Stock and Watson's Vector Autoregressions ("run_sr"). The results are computed using the median response approach, but you also have the option to utilize Fry and Pagan's median target method, which includes comprehensive analysis such as Forecast Error Variance Decomposition (FEVD) and Historical Decomposition.
